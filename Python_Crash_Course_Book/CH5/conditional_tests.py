5-1. 
Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')

print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')

Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate to True and another five tests evaluate to False.
