Favorite Fruit: Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.

*Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
*Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your list. If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!
